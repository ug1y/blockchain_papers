# Blockchain papers
According to my preference, I collect prevalent papers about blockchain and also make some notes for academic research. All papers are classified into seven categories.

## List of categories
- [Overview](#Overview)
- [Consensus](#Consensus)
- [Scalability](#Scalability)
- [Privacy](#Privacy)
- [Analysis](#Analysis)
- [Smart Contract](#Smart-Contract)

## Overview
['08] [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](Overview/2008_Bitcoin_A_Peer-to-Peer_Electronic_Cash_System.pdf). Nakamoto S. 
>Note: The first paper that introduced the concept of blockchain. This paper presented a complete system by mainly defining transactions with multi-input and multi-output, chain structure of blocks containing transactions and proof of work for the majority decision. Besides, the incentive mechanism implies that the one who creates a new block gains reward.

[S&P '15] [SoK: Research Perspectives and Challenges for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies](Overview/2015_SoK_Research_perspectives_and_challenges_for_bitcoin_and_cryptocurrencies.pdf). Bonneau J, Miller A, Clark J, Narayanan A, Kroll JA, Felten EW. 
>Note: This paper provided the first systematic exposition Bitcoin and the many related cryptocurrencies. The authors identified three key components of Bitcoin’s design, which is Transaction & Scripts, Consensus & Mining, and Peer-to-Peer Network. The analysis of Bitcoin’s properties and future stability stands in theory position to get some insight. This paper is good for readers to grasp the core of Bitcoin.
